# Initial RouterOS Configuration

## First Login

I first logged into the hEX with Winbox and was given the option to start with a blank configuration, or some typical home router defaults. I chose to clear the configuration, set a static IP on ether2, and a DHCP client on ether1, so I could connect to my current LAN and e.g. upgrade the OS.
